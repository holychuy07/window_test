Welcome to my GitHub!

Hi, I'm holychuy07, an aspiring developer with a passion for AI, automation, and no-code solutions. My journey into the world of technology is driven by a simple yet powerful goal: to build AI agents that help businesses automate tasks and boost productivity.
I believe that automation and AI are shaping the future, and I want to be part of that transformation by developing smart, accessible, and scalable solutions. While I'm currently focusing on no-code tools, I also recognize the importance of learning programming to unlock more customization and flexibility in building AI-powered applications.

What I'm working On
I'm in the early stages of my programming and AI automation journey, but i'm actively working on:

Learning web development, automation, and AI concepts from scratch.
Exploring no-code platforms like Make, N8n, and Relevance AI to develop AI-powered workflows.
Practicing version control with Git and GitHub to collaborate and manage projects effectively.
Seetting up a solid development environment (Xubuntu on VirtualBox) for coding and testing.
Experimenting with AI-powered summarization and automation tools, such as an AI Lazy Reader + AI video report generator.
My Goals and Vision
My long-term goal is to develop and launch AI automation agents that:

Help small businesses streamline repetitive tasks.
Make AI-driven workflows accessible through no-code solutions.
Combine no-code and programming to create advanced automation tools.
Enable businesses to save time, reduce costs, and boost efficiency.
I am to release at least one AI automation agent per month, continuously improving my skills while building practical tools for real-world use.

What I'm Currently Learning
I'm focusing on three key areas:

Programming and Development

Understanding the fundamentals of programming (starting with Python and JavaScript).
Learning web development to build AI-powered dashboards and automation tools.
Exploring backend development to enhance automation capabilities.
AI and Automation

Testing and implementing AI-powered tools for summarization, automation, and business optimization.
Experimenting with AI models that can analyze text, generate insights, and automate repetitive tasks.
Working with no-code automation platforms to create seamless workflows.
Software and tools

No-code automation: Make, N8n, Relevance AI.
Development Environment: Linux (Xubuntu) on VirtualBox.
Version Control: Git & Github for tracking progress and collaborating on project.
Cloud and APIs: Learning how to integrate AI models into real-world applications.
Skills and Techonologies I'm Exploring
Programming Languages: Python (beginner), JavaScript (beginner)
Automation Tools: Make, N8n, Relevance AI
Development Environment: Linux (Xubuntu), VirtualBox
Version Control: Git & Github
Cloud and APIs: Exploring AI and automation API integrations
